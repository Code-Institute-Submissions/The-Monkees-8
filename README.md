# The Monkees Website

The website contains 4 sections - homepage, music page, gallery, and events page.

## UX

The website is for a band, popular in the 1960s and 1970s.
I created a fairly classical website design for this reason.


Wireframes.

# Features

- Playing Music

Future features: form functionality.

## Technologies Used:

HTML and CSS for the structure and basic styling.

[Bootstrap v4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) for the layout.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts, Abril Fatface and PT Sans.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the social media logo symbols.

# Deployment

I deployed the page with GitHub Pages.

Made with a lot of help from the Code Institute tutors.
