# The Monkees Website

The website contains 4 sections - homepage, music page, gallery, and contact page.

## UX

The website is for a band, popular in the 1960s and 1970s.
I created a fairly classical website design for this reason.

The wireframes I made on Balsamiq are included in the repository.

## User Stories

- Someone wanting to contact the band to perform at an event
- Someone wanting to listen to the band's music
- Someone wanting to see images of the band
- Someone wanting to see a the different albums of the band

## Features

- Playing Music

Future features: form functionality.

## Technologies Used:

HTML and CSS for the structure and basic styling.

[Bootstrap v4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) for the layout.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts, Abril Fatface and PT Sans.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the social media logo symbols.

## Testing

I tested the HTML with [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
I tested the CSS with [Jigsaw - CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

## Deployment

I deployed the page with GitHub Pages.
